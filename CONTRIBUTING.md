    * Make a pull request, and be sure to fill out the information in the template.


# How to report a bug
### Security issues
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

### For non-security issues
Please open an issue and use the template provided. Please add the "Bug" label.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Before suggesting a feature, please read through the [Roadmap to MVP](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro#roadmap-to-mvp) and check the backlog to make sure that the story doesn't exist already. Once you're ready to suggest the feature or enhancement, open an issue and use the provided template. Please also add the "feature request" label.

# Code review process
After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed within 10 business days and we will give you feedback on any needed changes. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Code Style
ESLint is used for checking JavaScript code style. It is also useful for avoiding some errors. Please use indentation of 2 spaces, and no semicolons. Please use ES2015 (ES6).
