  <h2 class="ui medium header">What's a retro?</h2>
  <p>'Retro' is short for retrospective. Retrospectives are used by software teams to reflect on their recent work, with the aim of identifying where they can improve, and--more importantly--of generating action items that will help them <i>make</i> those improvements.</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">How much does RemoteRetro cost?</h2>
  <p>Zero! Zilch! Nada! It's FREE.</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">Will it always be free?</h2>
  <p>We can't make any promises, but we certainly hope so!</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">Who can use RemoteRetro?</h2>
  <p>Anyone with a Google account of any kind can enter a retrospective!</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">My team is entirely colocated. Should we use RemoteRetro?</h2>
  <p>You certainly <i>could</i>, but we don't recommend it, as there's no substitute for face-to-face communication. Use a whiteboard!</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">Where can I learn about planned features and updates?</h2>
  <p>Our backlog resides in <a href="https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro/issues">GitHub issues</a>, which can be viewed in priority order via the wonderful <a href="http://zenhub.io/">ZenHub Chrome extension</span></a>.</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">How many people should participate in a retro?</h2>

  <p>Ideally, a retrospective will contain no more than 10 people. Exceed 10, and participants will check out because they feel they can go unnoticed. If you can, keep the numbers low!</p>

  <h2 class="ui medium header">How can I submit feedback on my experience?</h2>
  <p>Users are presented with a survey at the close of their first retro. Additionally, bugs and feature requests can be filed via GitHub issues at <a href="https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro/issues/new">https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro/issues/new</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:remote_retro@stridenyc.com">remote_retro@stridenyc.com</a></p>
